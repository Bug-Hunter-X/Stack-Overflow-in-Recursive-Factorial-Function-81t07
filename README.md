# Stack Overflow in Recursive Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: stack overflow due to unbounded recursion. The `foo` function calculates the factorial recursively, but lacks proper handling for large inputs, leading to excessive recursive calls and ultimately a stack overflow.  The solution demonstrates how to address this by using an iterative approach.
